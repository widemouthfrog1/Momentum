### Integration Programmer

## My Contribution

### All
* ElevatorPlatform.cs
    - This file was created so that platforms could move around, however due to a problem with moving the player around it was removed and not used in the final game.

### Most
* Wall.cs
    - I helped peer program this file with Karl. This script is used to create a wall made of smaller square game objects that are linked together using fixed joints. The generated wall can have its variables altered to match the size of the wall such as break force.

### Touched
* Follow_Camera.cs
    - Changed it so its initial position is locked onto the players starting position.

[Most Interesting Code](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/comp313-2019-a3/t9/comp313_game_prototype/blob/master/Assets/ElevatorPlatform.cs)\
This would have been very interesting and useful for our game if not for the stutter movement when the player was on the platform. I was not sure why this happened but assumed it was to do with how the player script was done.

[Code I am most proud of](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/comp313-2019-a3/t9/comp313_game_prototype/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Wall.cs)\
I enjoyed play testing this coding and experimenting with different solutions to get the best outcome and most satisfying way for the player to fly at a wall at full speed and break the wall.

## What I've Learnt
* Importance of planning and regular meetings
* Using agile to work in a group to create a game
* Using tile mapping in unity to create levels
* Merging unity code and scripts with other peoples branches and how to fix merge conflicts
* How useful peer programming can be
* It's important to share knowledge to others might not have
* Using unity inbuild things like fixed joints, colliders and rigidbody

## Most Important Thing I Can Take From This Project
Planning is everything. Without a good plan things fall apart and people are left not knowing what to do. I personally  found this a problem at the start with not much planning or direction on what to do. It also means that without a good plan then you can get very behind on where you are meant to be at in the project. This happened to use and we were left at the very end to try rush create some levels for the game because we spend too much time creating features and not much time on actual level designs or gameplay/testing.
